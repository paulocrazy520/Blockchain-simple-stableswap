# SimpleSwap contracts
SimpleSwap protocol provides an interface for seamless exchange of ERC20 tokens on Ethereum. By eliminating unnecessary forms of rent extraction and middlemen it allows faster, more efficient exchange. Token listing is open and free. All smart contract functions are public and all upgrades are opt-in.


## Features
* Use USDx as reserve token in the exchange for token pairs
* Add support for any ERC20 token using ERC1155
* Join liquidity pools to collect fees on USDx-ERC20 pairs
* Liquidity-sensitive automated pricing using constant product formula
* Trade USDx for any ERC20 without wrapping
* Trade any ERC20 for any ERC20 in a single transaction
* Trade and transfer to a different address in a single transaction
* Lowest gas cost of any decentralized exchange


## How does it work
Unlike Uniswap is made up of a series of ETH-ERC20 exchange contracts, SimpleSwap is just one contract followed by ERC1155 to track balances of token pairs. This can bring some benefits below.
  1. Reduce gas in the situation of trading ERC20 for ERC20. SimpleSwap only need to update contract state without any internal transactions, however uniswap need some internal transactions.
  2. No need to create new contract when creating a liquidity pool of new ERC20. Again, SimpleSwap only need to update contract state to add new liquidity pool. Therefore, SimpleSwap has no behaviors like creating exchange.

SimpleSwap holds reserves of both USDx and its associated ERC20 token. Anyone can become a liquidity provider on the exchange and contribute to its reserves. This is different than buying or selling; it requires depositing an equivalent value of both USDx and the relevant ERC20 token.
Liquidity is pooled across all providers and ERC1155 `balanceOf(address _owner, uint256 _id)` is used to track each providers relative contribution. "_id" is `uint256(tokenAddress)` which is  represented by ERC20. Balance for token id increases when liquidity is deposited into the system and can decrease at any time to withdraw a proportional share of the reserves.

SimpleSwap is automated market makers between an USDx-ERC20 pair. Traders can swap between the two in either direction by adding to the liquidity reserve of one and withdrawing from the reserve of the other.
